# Landing page
 I completed a landing page project using HTML and CSS. The website showcases the BMW M5 Competition, featuring its specifications, images, and more. The page is well-designed, using columns, headers, footers, and attention to layout, padding, and color palettes to create a visually appealing and user-friendlyÂ design.
